To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions

- Accurecy: Training: More than90% Validation:Nearly 80%

- model accuracy has improved

- the class rebalance has helped treat the overfitting to some extent.

- more epochs and more layers can be used to build much better model
